				<p>I just wrapped up the first quarter of my master&rsquo;s degree program. In
my project-driven Machine Learning class, I chose to work on a fake
face detection task. I picked this topic mostly because I had no
experience with computer vision or convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and wanted to try something totally new to me, plus I knew that
there was an obvious ethics component to facial recognition AI and
wanted to feature that in my work.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting the topic to be <em>quite</em> so timely, but after Google
fired Timnit Gebru for questioning both their AI ethics and their
diversity, equality and inclusion practices, I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/Mantzarlis/status/1338220767042002945?s=19">a jaw-dropping
thread</a>
pop up in my Twitter feed. Someone had created a fake account, using
GAN generated fake face profile images, claiming to be one of
Dr. Gebru&rsquo;s former colleagues, in order to smear her reputation.</p>
<p><img src="/alexios-thread.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/jeff-jeffries.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/julia-smith-kleinberg.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Even worse, a professor emeritus from the UW CSE department, Pedro
Domingos, engaged with and even retweeted this account, apparently not
realizing it was a fake:</p>
<p><img src="/julia-smith-kleinberg-thread.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>This made it very clear to me that &ldquo;deep fakes&rdquo; is <em>not</em> a toy problem
or a hypothetical future problem, but that the technology is being
deployed <em>right now</em> to spread disinformation online. So this points
to the need for technology to detect and flag fakes, in order to keep
up in the &ldquo;arms race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My project team took the obvious approach to the problem&ndash;get a
dataset consisting of real human face images and another dataset of
fake ones generated by <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan">StyleGAN</a>,
and then train a CNN model to distinguish between the two
datasets. While we got promising results (&gt;97% test accuracy) on the
original datasets, we knew that face image datasets tend to have
selection bias toward middle-aged, white faces, so we wanted to test
whether our model performed equally well on subjects of different
demographics.</p>
<p>In order to conduct that fairness assessment, we needed a
demographically labeled dataset of both real and fake faces, so we
took the <a href="https://github.com/joojs/fairface">FairFace</a> dataset, then
used
<a href="https://github.com/eladrich/pixel2style2pixel">pixel2style2pixel</a> as
an autoencoder, to embed each image into the latent space of the
StyleGAN network and then extract it back out into an image.</p>
<p>The results of this process were pretty interesting. The
pixel2style2pixel model was able to reconstruct faces very similar to
the originals, removing things like hands partially covering faces and
bruises and blemishes, though it sometimes made mistakes like
misinterpreting head coverings as hair. Here are some samples:</p>
<p><img src="/fair2fake.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my own face before and after running through the face falsifier
network, which feels pretty eerie to look at:</p>
<p><img src="/alex-fake.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>What we found in the process, though, was that our model trained on
the first dataset <strong>totally</strong> failed to generalize to the second
dataset, with accuracy only in the mid 50s, only marginally better
than a coin toss. So we decided not to bother with a fairness
assessment on a clearly useless model.  Instead, we retrained and
scored the model on a combined dataset drawn from both datasets. We
found that this new model performed better than our first model on
both the original dataset and the combined dataset, probably due to
the additional training examples, and it also performed with almost
exactly the same metrics across demographic splits of male/female,
white/non-white, black/non-black, elderly/non-elderly, and
child/non-child.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a ton more work to be done in the space, and I still have
doubts about whether the model really detected something intrinsic to
fake faces that will generalizes well across more datasets. But for
now, I think this experience demonstrates the value of using a
diverse, heterogenous input dataset, testing the model on truly
out-of-sample data, and considering and planning for a model fairness
assessment up front.</p>
<p>Our code is available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/alexkyllo/fake-faces/">https://github.com/alexkyllo/fake-faces/</a></p>
<p>Winter quarter will be a little change of pace as I&rsquo;m taking High
Performance Computing, which will focus on GPU programming with CUDA.
I&rsquo;m pretty excited for it because I hope to brush up on my
computational linear algebra and better understand what is actually
happening when I train a neural network model on my GPU.</p>
