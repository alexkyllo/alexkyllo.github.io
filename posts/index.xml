I thought of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a> as a tool
(from 1976!) for building Linux binaries from compiled languages,
and it didn't occur to me how it could be useful in my workflow. Make is
usually part of any curriculum for software engineers learning C/C++, but
I seldom if ever see it mentioned in data science courses or tutorials.</p>
<p>Today, I use Make for all of my software and data science projects, and I
consider it the most important tool for reproducibility. It ships with
Linux and Mac, and there is a <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm">Windows installer</a>
available. I love that it's language-agnostic, so it's perfect for teams
where different people use R, Python, or other languages for their analysis code.
It also gives you a &ldquo;single point of contact&rdquo; for all the scripts and commands
in your project, so you can just type <code>make</code> or
<code>make [task name]</code> instead of having to remember and re-type each command.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">GNU Make Manual</a>
is quite approachable while also providing great detail, but in a nutshell,
you create a file called <code>Makefile</code> in your project directory and add to it
a set of &ldquo;rules&rdquo; for producing output files from input files, in this form:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-make" data-lang="make"><span style="color:#a6e22e">targets </span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> prerequisites
    recipe
</code></pre></div><p>A &ldquo;target&rdquo; and a &ldquo;prerequisite&rdquo; are usually filenames, but can also be just
names for tasks (called &ldquo;phony&rdquo; targets).</p>
<p>So why is this so useful for data science projects?</p>
<p>Data analysis code typically involves five steps for processing data:</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting it</li>
<li>Cleaning it</li>
<li>Exploring it</li>
<li>Modeling it</li>
<li>Interpreting it</li>
</ol>
<p>Without a disciplined approach, a typical R or Python script or notebook file
will do all of these steps together, perhaps interleaved, making it difficult
to pull the steps apart so that they can be executed separately.</p>
<p>Why is it important to separate them? Some steps may process large quantities of
data, so you don't want to re-run everything each time you change your script.
Caching intermediate results saves you a lot of time as you're developing.</p>
<p>Also, if you have mutli-language scenarios, say you want to visualize your data
with <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>
before training a predictive model with <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a>,
it's easiest to separate these steps into
different scripts in different languages, rather than doing something
complicated like spawning a Python subprocess from within R or vice versa.</p>
<p>Here's an example of what a Makefile might look like, for generating a paper
written in LaTeX, containing two plots generated by an R script and a Python
script, from a CSV file created by a SQL database query:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-make" data-lang="make"><span style="color:#a6e22e">default </span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> paper.pdf

<span style="color:#a6e22e">paper.pdf </span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> paper.tex figure-01.png figure-02.png
    pdflatex paper.tex

<span style="color:#a6e22e">figure-01.png </span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> plot.R data.csv
    Rscript plot.R

<span style="color:#a6e22e">figure-02.png </span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> plot.py data.csv
    python plot.py

<span style="color:#a6e22e">data.csv</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> query.sql
    sql2csv --db <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;sqlite:///database.db&#34;</span> query.sql
</code></pre></div><p>Given this Makefile, when you type <code>make</code>, it will execute each of these
recipes in dependency order, and then if you type <code>make</code> again, it will
do nothing, because the dependencies haven't changed. Make looks at the
file modified timestamps to see which steps actually need to be redone.
If you change the <code>query.sql</code> file and type <code>make</code> again, it will rerun
everything because that's the first item in the dependency chain, but if you
only change the <code>paper.tex</code> file, then only the
recipe for <code>paper.pdf</code> will be rerun the next time you type <code>make</code>, because
nothing upstream of it changed. This is an incredible time-saver when some of
your recipes take a long time to run, as is often the case with data science projects.
I've seen many other tools designed to solve this problem, most of them
language-specific and much more complex to learn and use than Make.</p>
<p>As far as how to structure a new project, there isn't really an accepted standard
data science code project structure or framework.
The closest thing might be
<a href="https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/#directory-structure">Cookiecutter Data Science</a>
(which also utilizes a Makefile), though it's Python-specific and I haven't seen
it used &ldquo;in the wild&rdquo; yet. If you use a Makefile in your project, though, it doesn't
really matter that much how you structure your directories or even what language you use,
as thinking in terms of Make recipes will encourage you to break up your analysis
scripts into a pipeline of small,
dependent, repeatable steps with cached results. Then when a colleague picks up
your project to review your work or enhance it, just looking at the Makefile will
give them a clear idea of how it's put together.
So use Make for your data science projects and encourage your coworkers to do the
same&ndash;you will thank each other!</p>

			<description>I&#39;ve read many times that the key to success is to do things and tell people.
In the new decade, I am going to put much more effort into the &amp;ldquo;tell people&amp;rdquo; part.</description>
